This is a <a href=\"https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2018/08/22/bing-net-core.aspx\">cornerstone</a> of the technology, so this is less than surprising, but it does affect how cost is measured amongst hosting possibilities, notably for cases where you pay by the millisecond.</p>\n<p>I often find the best way to compare something is just to move it around in production. No simulation, and so long as it is done correctly, you are comparing literal apples to apples. I have an application that spans 6 azure function apps, uses durable functions, and has both long and short running functions.
